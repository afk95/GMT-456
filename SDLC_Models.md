# Three different SDLC methodologies
**Waterfall Model**
Waterfall model is the very first model that is used in SDLC. It is also known as the linear sequential model.
In this model, the outcome of one phase is the input for the next phase. Development of the next phase starts only when the previous phase is complete.
*First, Requirement gathering and analysis is done. Once the requirement is freeze then only the System Design can start. Herein, the SRS document created is the output for the Requirement phase and it acts as an input for the System Design.
*In System Design Software architecture and Design, documents which act as an input for the next phase are created i.e. Implementation and coding.
*In the Implementation phase, coding is done and the software developed is the input for the next phase i.e. testing.
*In the testing phase, the developed code is tested thoroughly to detect the defects in the software. Defects are logged into the defect tracking tool and are retested once fixed. *Bug logging, Retest, Regression testing goes on until the time the software is in go-live state.
*In the Deployment phase, the developed code is moved into production after the sign off is given by the customer.
*Any issues in the production environment are resolved by the developers which come under maintenance.
